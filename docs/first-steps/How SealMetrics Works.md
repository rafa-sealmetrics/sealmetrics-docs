## **Does SEAL Metrics prioritize KPIs over legality?**

Not at all. We go even further. We don’t track anything that could compromise users' privacy. For example, if tracking a particular KPI would violate users' privacy, we won’t track it, even if it is allowed by regulations.

 

## **What is SEAL Metrics’ privacy policy?**

Our stance has been clear from the beginning: for us, privacy is more than a policy—it’s a philosophy. As some of our team members are marketers, we sought a web analytics solution that respects both user and company privacy, while also being effective for data-driven decision-making. Our priority is to protect users' privacy, even if it means being more restrictive than some regulations. This ensures that users, professionals, and companies know they are using a privacy-compliant solution.

 

## **What regulations does SEAL Metrics follow?**

Before developing SEAL Metrics, we consulted with numerous lawyers and privacy specialists. Our goal was to create a privacy-focused web analytics solution that wouldn’t become obsolete if privacy regulations were to become more stringent.

We understood that GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive, CCPA, PECR, and any new regulations that may emerge in the future all share a common goal: protecting the privacy of citizens. Privacy is a fundamental human right, so SEAL Metrics does not track individuals.

SEAL Metrics doesn’t track people’s online journeys or individual activities; it’s impossible to connect our data to any specific person.
